Embedded II Project and Lab Files

## Overview
  This is an in progress project where I am designing an building an LCR meter for under $15 using a simple embedded microcontroller and general runles of electronics to be able to calculate the complonents being measured. This product is to be self contained where it does not requrie the use of a computer and comunication over UART however does have debug methods when done. This will use a HD44780 Display and pushbuttons for the interface. It is capable of measureing Voltage, Resistance, Capacitance, Inductance, and ESR. This will also have an Auto fuction at the end there it will determine what is being measured and report back its value.
